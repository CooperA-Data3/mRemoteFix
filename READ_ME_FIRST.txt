DISCLAIMER: I am not a professional coder. I do this for fun. If my code is buggy or doesn't work, then follow the manual instructions below


BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING:

- Move this folder (mRemoteFix) to your Documents folder, otherwise my low-IQ code will get confused and crap itself.


Instructions:

1. Run "Start.exe"
2. Follow the on-screen prompts. You may be asked to enter admin credentials more than once. This is normal for the fix process because it is moving system files.
3. Check C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc to check "hosts" is the only file in the "etc" folder. If it's not, follow manual instructions
4. Once the program has finished, in the rare instance it works, run "Finish_Up.bat" This will restart your computer, so make sure you save your work.
5. Your PC will restart. Once it has booted back up, open mRemoteNG, and try to connect to a VM. If you get the same error as before, I tried lol.


MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc and delete all files in the "etc" folder
2. In the folder this note is in, (C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\mRemoteFix) there should be a file named "hosts".
3. Copy that file, and paste it in the "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc" folder, then run "Finish_Up.bat". This will restart your PC, so save your work.
4. Your PC will restart. Once it has booted back up, open mRemoteNG, and try to connect to a VM. If you get the same error as before, I tried lol.
